# Introduction

To mitigate the impact of radiation exposure in microelectronics circuits, multiple methods have emerged in order to be studied, RHbD was the choosen method, basically this technique rely in the modification of the transistor layout geometry.
Using a commercial technology of 130 nm from UMC the main goal is to develop an ELT library with an NMOS and PMOS PCell, which can be used to design any circuit layout using radiation tolerant transistors. In this thesis two different types of layout for radiation tolerant were developed, presented as a rectangular and a octagonal PCell.

# Tools used for the development of PCell

* SKILL


# How to run the Scripts:

1) run shell: composer install
