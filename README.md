The main goal is to develop an \ac{ELT} library with an \ac{NMOS} and \ac{PMOS} \ac{PCell}, which can be used to design any circuit layout using radiation tolerant transistors. In this thesis two different types of layout for radiation tolerant were developed, presented as a rectangular and a octagonal \ac{PCell}
