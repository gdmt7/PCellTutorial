# PCellTutorial

The main goal is to develop an ELT library with an NMOS and PMOS PCell, which can be used to design any circuit layout using radiation tolerant transistors. In this thesis two different types of layout for radiation tolerant were developed, presented as a rectangular and a octagonal PCell.
